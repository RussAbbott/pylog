\section{Conclusion}
  Pylog offers a way to integrate logic programming features into a Python environment.
  
  \begin{itemize}
  \item The magic of unification requires little more than linked chains.
  \item Prolog's control structures, including "backtracking," can be implemented as nested \textbftt{for} loops, with \textbftt{yield} and \textbftt{yield from} gluing the pieces together.
\end{itemize}
