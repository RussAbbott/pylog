class Bool_Yield_Wrapper:
  """
  Objects of this class are created to serve as generators. It takes two steps.
  Suppose gen is a generator, i.e.,

  def gen():
      yield

  Such generators are decorated with @bool_yield_wrapper, which returns a function that will create an
  instance of this class when invoked.

  That function is invoked by calling the original generator, e.g.,

  runnable_gen = bool_yield_wrapper(gen)(...)

  runnable_gen will be an instance of Bool_Yield_Wrapper, this class. It is run through its has_more( ) method. E.g.
    while runnable_gen.has_more( ):
        <do something>

  The original gen function must be such that it returns its value through one of its parameters.
  To use the append function as an example,

  @bool_yield_wrapper
  def append(_Xs: Union[PrList, Var], Ys: Union[PrList, Var], _Zs: Union[PrList, Var]):
      ....

  runnable_append = append(Xs, Ys, Zs) # Presumably one or more of Xs, Ys, and Zs is uninstantiated.

  while runnable_append.has_more( ): ... will instantiate the uninstantiated variables.

    (Xs, Ys, Zs) = (Var(), Var(), PrList( [1, 2, 3] )
    runnable_append = append(Xs, Ys, Zs)
    while runnable_append.has_more( ):
        print(f'Xs = {Xs}\nYs = {Ys}\nZs = {Zs}')
        # Prints the various instantiations of Xs and Ys, which, when concatenated, produce Zs.

  These Bool_Yield_Wrapper objects are used in "with" and "while" statements. The current strategy is to
  have a with-statement and embedded while-statement for each generator. For example:

      with append(Xs, Ys, Zs) as gen:
          while gen.has_more():
              <do something>

  The body of the while-loop will repeat each time the generator succeeds.
