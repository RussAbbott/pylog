## Dev Environment Setup

1. `cd` to the parent directory (i.e. the one that has setup.py in it)
2. run `pip install -e .`. The parameter `-e` will install the package with a symlink, so that changes to the source files will be immediately available to other users of the package on our system.
3. Use it in examples/tests by importing modules from `pylog` package
