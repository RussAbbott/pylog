A puzzle from GeekOverdose: https://geekoverdose.wordpress.com/2015/10/31/solving-logic-puzzles-in-prolog-puzzle-1-of-3/
A relatively simple puzzle of this genre.
Prolog solution provided at that site.

                        ----------------------------------------------------------------

There are 4 students: Amy, Carrie, Erma, and Tracy. 
Each has one scholarship and one major subject.  
The available scholarships are: $25,000, $30,000, $35,000 and $40,000. 
The available majors are: Astronomy, Comp Sci, English, and Philosophy. 

Using the following clues, determine which student has which scholarship and studies which subject.

1. The student who studies Astronomy gets a smaller scholarship than Amy.
2. Amy studies either English or Philosophy.
3. The student who studies Comp Sci has a $5,000 bigger scholarship than Carrie.
4. Erma has a $10,000 bigger scholarship than Carrie.
5. Tracy has a bigger scholarship than the student who studies English.

The (unique) solution.

Students: 
	Carrie(English, 25)
	Tracy(Comp Sci, 30)
	Erma(Astronomy, 35)
	Amy(Philosophy, 40)
