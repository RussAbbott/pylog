"""
One version of the famous Zebra problem. (They are all similar, but the names are often different.)

There are 5 houses in a row. Each has a family of a unique nationality.
Each house also has a color, a pet, a favorite smoke, and a favorite drink.

1. The English live in the red house.
2. The Spanish have a dog.
3. They drink coffee in the green house.
4. The Ukrainians drink tea.
5. The green house is immediately to the right of the white house.
6. The Old Gold smokers have snails.
7. They smoke Kool in the yellow house.
8. They drink milk in the middle house.
9. The Norwegians live in the first house on the left.
10. The Chesterfield smokers live next to the fox.
11. They smoke Kool in the house next to the horse.
12. The Lucky smokers drink juice.
13. The Japanese smoke Parliament.
14. The Norwegians live next to the blue house.

Who has a zebra and who drinks water?
