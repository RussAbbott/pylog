## Abstract (outline from [The Programming Journal](https://programming-journal.org/cfp/))

<dl><dt>Context: What is the broad context of the work? What is the importance of the general research area?</dt>
<dd>Pylog inhabits three programming contexts.<br/><br/>
 
**a)** Pylog explores the integration of two distinct programming language paradigms: (i) the modern general purpose programming paradigm, which often includes features of procedural programming, object-oriented programming, functional programming, and meta-programming, here represented by Python, and (ii) logic programming, whose primary features are logic variables (and unification) and built-in depth-first search, here represented by Prolog. These logic programming feature are generally missing from modern general purpose languages. Pylog illustrates how these two features can be implemented in and integated into Python. 

**b)** Pylog demonstrates the breadth and broad applicability of Python. Although Python is now the most widely used programming language for teaching introductory programming, it has also become very widely used for sophisticated programming tasks. One of the reasons for its popularity is the range of capabilities it offers—most of which are not used in elementary programming classes or for the sort of scripting applications with which Python is often associated. Pylog makes effective use of many of those capabilities.  

**c)** Pylog examplifies programming at its best. Pylog is first-of-all a programming exercise: How can the primary features of logic programming be integrated with Python? Secondly, Pylog uses features of Python in ways that aere both intended and innovative. The overall result is software worth studying. From the perspective of [The Programming Journal](https://programming-journal.org/cfp/), it would fit into its Art-of-Programming category.
</dd>

<dt>Inquiry: What problem or question does the paper address? How has this problem or question been addressed by others (if at all)?</dt>
<dd>The primary issue addressed in the paper-and in Pylog itself-is how logic variables and backtracking can be integrated cleanly into a Python framework. A fair amount of work has been done in this area: see _Related Work_. Most of it has been preliminary in one way or another. Pylog is the first complete system (as far as we know) to achieve the goal of integration.</dd>

<dt>Approach: What was done that unveiled new knowledge?</dt>
<dd>Pylog, exhibits the integration mentined above. The paper discusses-and Pylon demonstrates-how logic variables and backtracking can be interwoven with standard Python data structures and control structures.</dd>

<dt>Knowledge: What new facts were uncovered? If the research was not results oriented, what new capabilities are enabled by the work?</dt>
<dd>Pylon is available as a logic programming library for use in Python software.</dd>

<dt>Grounding: What argument, feasibility proof, artifacts, or results and evaluation support this work?</dt>
<dd>Pylog demonstrates by its existence and functionality that the goal of integrating logic variables and backtracking with Python can be achieved.</dd>

<dt>Importance: Why does this work matter?</dt>
<dd>This work demonstrates the power and elegance of well-designed software.

## Introduction

Prolog, a programming language derived from logic, was developed in the 1970s. It became very popular during the 1980s as an AI language, especially in Japan as part of their [5th generation project](https://www.nytimes.com/1992/06/05/business/fifth-generation-became-japan-s-lost-generation.html). 

Prolog went out of favor because [it was difficult to trace the execution of Prolog programs](https://synthese.wordpress.com/2010/08/21/prologs-death/)—which made debugging very challenging.

Structurally, Prolog is both one of the simplest of all programming languages—you can learn it very quickly—and one of the most interesting. It is quite different from virtually all other programming languages. In Prolog you make assertions of facts and then pose questions about those facts. Answers are *unified* with (rather than assigned to) variables.  Prolog is seductively elegant and powerful. 

We can look a few examples [here](https://swish.swi-prolog.org/p/kb_rja.pl).

## SWI-Prolog

[SWI-Prolog](http://www.swi-prolog.org/) has kept the Prolog flame burning and seems to have developed a successful community of Prolog users.

<dt>From the <a href="http://www.swi-prolog.org/features.html">SWI-Prolog website</a></dt>
<dd> SWI-Prolog is a versatile implementation of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prolog">Prolog language</a>. Although SWI-Prolog gained its popularity primarily in education, its development is mostly driven by the needs for application development. This is facilitated by a rich interface to other IT components by supporting many document types and (network) protocols as well as a comprehensive low-level interface to C that is the basis for high-level interfaces to C++, Java (bundled), C#, Python, etc (externally available). Data type extensions such as dicts and strings as well as full support for Unicode and unbounded integers simplify smooth exchange of data with other components.<br /><br />
SWI-Prolog aims at scalability. Its robust support for multi-threading exploits multi-core hardware efficiently and simplifies embedding in concurrent applications. Its Just In Time Indexing (JITI) provides transparent and efficient support for predicates with millions of clauses.</dd>

Week 7 is a Prolog tutorial. You should be able to understand it without first reading weeks 5 and 6. But those weeks are important. They show how to  implement many Prolog features in Python.

## Pylog: prolog in Python
This repository is a Python implementation of many Prolog features. It is a fork of Piumarta’s [`unify.py`](http://www.ritsumei.ac.jp/~piumarta/pl/src/unify.py).

As an introductory example, consider the following (Python) code—adapted from [Piumarta's week 5 exercises](http://www.ritsumei.ac.jp/~piumarta/pl/ex/PL-05-ex.py). (You can run it [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1BkWBGY0GpOYqHLpyylzbPU9OLdyqxSmk).) (The type annotations are not required, but they are useful to understand what's going on.) 

```python
from typing import Generator

def isEven(i: int) -> Generator[None, None, None]:
    if i % 2 == 0:
        print(f'{i}-even', end = ', ')
        yield 
    else:
        print(f'{i}-odd', end = ', ')
        
evens = [i for i in range(10) for _ in isEven(i)]

print(f'\n{evens}')
        
```
Can you figure out how the preceding produces these results? 
```python
0-even, 1-odd, 2-even, 3-odd, 4-even, 5-odd, 6-even, 7-odd, 8-even, 9-odd,
[0, 2, 4, 6, 8] 
```
In particular, what does 

```python 
for _ in isEven(i)
``` 

do in the list comprehension?

In Prolog, program components are understood as predicates. They may *succeed* or *fail*. To succeed/fail means that the system was/was not able to establish that the predicate holds given the information available. 

Success or failure is implemented in Python through generators. A generator that **yield**s a result (at the Python level) is said to succeed (at the Prolog level); one that does not **yield** a result, fails (at the Prolog level).

In this case, `isEven(i)` succeeds/fails when `i` is even/odd. (In either case it produces an output line.) When

```python
for _ in isEven(i)
```

succeeds/fails for a given `i`, the list comprehension completes/fails to complete the iteration for that `i` and includes/does not include `i` in the generated list.

## File dependencies/`imports from` relations

```
logic_variables: none
control_structures: logic_variables

super_sequence: control_structures, logic_variables
linked_list and sequences: control_structures, logic_variables, super_sequence

n_queens: logic_variables, sequences
trains: control_structures, logic_variables, 
puzzle: logic_variables, super_sequence
zebra_problem: control_structures, logic_variables, puzzles
scholarship_problem: control_structures, logic_variables, puzzles, super_sequence

```
## Naming conventions

For the most part, Python identifier names follow PEP 8 conventions: all lower case, with underscores between words; no camel case except for class names.

However, since Prolog uses identifiers that begin with an upper case letter for Prolog variables, Python identifiers used as Prolog variables begin with upper case letters.

It's a worthwhile distinction to make. One can implement Prolog in any general purpose language. Pylog is notable because it integrates Python and Prolog.)
