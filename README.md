## Abstract (from [WI 2020](http://wi2020.vcrab.com.au/) paper)

We examine the history of Artificial Intelligence, from its audacious beginnings to the current day. We argue that constraint programming (a) is the rightful heir and modern-day descendent of that early work and (b) offers a more stable and reliable platform for AI than deep machine learning.

We offer a tutorial on constraint programming solvers that should be accessible to most software developers. We show how constraint programming works, how to implement constraint programming in Python, and how to integrate a Python constraint-programming solver with other Python code.
